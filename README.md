# Gartics-Gif-Expander
Convert the cumbersome gif replays to a single png

This software was originally designed for Gartics. The problem this solves is the inconvience of the Gartics replay. Gartic saves each game as a sequential gif, but it's hard to stop at and admire the details. This software is a simple GUI for non-command line users which converts the gifs from that game to a 2xN png which contains all of the frames of the gif neatly layed out. This can work on any gif.
